This is an app supposed to be solve below **headaches** to me:

>so many disturbing **notifications**, and apps stay background and eat your memory, I want a clean and fast phone. 
>After trying several assistant-like app(e.g. 360安全卫士，腾讯手机助手), I hate them all.

>e.g. 360安全卫士 pushes so many notifications to me(even after I've disabled "notificaiton" button in settings, 
it **continues** pushes notifications like "新增哼哈音乐识别"), I truly hate it.


**Contributes** your codes and build an app to manage our phones.
